              Our main goal is to make cooking more accessible, fun and creative for everyone. With
              the help of Artificial Intelligence, we have created an application that provides you
              with personalized recipes adapted to your preferences, helping you to explore new
              flavors and discover delicious dishes.
            </p>

              At CookMeal, we focus on making the meal planning process easy and making the most of
              the ingredients you have on hand. It doesn&apos;t matter if you are an experienced
              chef or a cooking beginner, our app will guide you every step of the way, from
              selecting recipes to preparing delicious dishes.
